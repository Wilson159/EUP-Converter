C# Console Application that helps with the renaming of EUP files in order to convert them from LSPDFR to FiveM.

> ***Please note that it will rename every file even if they are not .ytd files, this feature may come in the future though.***

> ***Additionally, like the program specifies when you run it, please run this program once per pack. Running more than once will result in file names such as: mp_f_freemode_01^mp_f_freemode_01^decl_diff_003_a_uni.ytd.***

The EUP Converter.exe will be provided if you wish to run this, the application may flag as a virus or pop up that it is from an unknown author. If you don't trust the .exe the C# project files are included so that you can view the code and make your own build.

I am not an experienced programmer so if you have any suggestions or errors, please contact me on Discord, Wilson#0159.
